In BUDA, eTexts are comprised of a base layer + at least one archival annotation layer, plus other annotation layers for different uses.  The base layer is a raw Unicode text file. The base layer contains Unicode text and line breaks that form a coordinate system.  The coordinate system includes a sequence number, position of start character and end character. The coordinate system is defined in the archival annotation layer.

The RDF representation of :Etext is derived from the base layer, a graph definining the coordinate system :EtextNonPaginated or :EtextPaginate, and a graph for the :ItemEtext that references the volume of the :ItemEtext. 

There will also be information such as a URI to the original source file, if applicable. For Tibetan, these typically are Sambhota Word or Tibet Doc files.

The reference to the containing :ItemEtext is a URI formed by appending the volume index to the :ItemEtext URI, like:

     :eTextInVolume bdr:I1KG443_003/volume/3

This URI refers to a volume blank node contained in the referenced Item.

Search chunks in the :Etext are derived from the original Unicode eText stream by breaking the stream at such locations to minimize the likelihood that the likely search terms will be broken across chunk boundaries. In Tibetan this is achieved by breaking the stream after the nearest shad codepoint following something like 300 tsegs. This assumes that most searches will not extend beyond a phrase boundary delimited by a shad (note there are actually a family of codepoints that count as shad in the Tibetan Unicode plane).

Each chunk is a blank node containing the chunk id - which is a virtual id serving only to order the sequence of contents to reassemble the original eText content, like:

    [ a EtextChunk ;
      :eTextChunk 3 ;
      :chunkContents \". . . the text contained in chunk 3 . . .\" ]

If the chunk is from an OCR'd text, then there is additional information indicating the starting chunk and character, and ending chunk and character for each page in the :ItemImageAsset from which the OCR'd material was derived. For example,

     [ a EtextPage ; :slice 46 ; 
       :sliceStartChunk 43 ; 
       :sliceStartChar 17 ;
       :sliceEndChunk 44 ;
       :sliceEndChar 138 ]

The character counts are in terms of Unicode codepoints in whatever representation is used, typically, UTF-8."""@en ;

OCR is considered ItemEtextPaginated and manual input saved in RTF format  considered :ItemEtextNonPaginated. These are distinguished because there are different stuctural characteristics in the :ItemEtext.

This models the directly the way in which the source gsan/thob yigs are written.

For example, here is the "tail" of bdr:L0RKL137:

bdr:L0RKL137 a :Lineage ;
      :lineageType bdr:LineageDbang ;
      :lineageObject bdr:T976 ;

      :lineageHolder [ a :LineageHolder ;

            :lineageDownFrom bdr:L0RKL134
            ]

Now in bdr:L0RKL134 there will be found a :LineageHolder with a :lineageWho of bdr:P3094 and all of the holders from then to the end of bdr:L0RKL134 are considered to be appended to bdr:L0RKL137:

bdr:L0RKL134 a :Lineage ;
      :lineageType bdr:LineageDbang ;
      :lineageObject bdr:T976 ;
. . .
      :lineageHolder [ a :LineageHolder ;

                  :lineageFrom bdr:P3093 ]
            ]
      :lineageHolder [ a :LineageHolder ;
            :lineageWho bdr:P3094 ;
            :lineageReceived [ a :LineageReceived ;
                  :lineageFrom bdr:P502 ]
            ]
      :lineageHolder [ a :LineageHolder ;
            :lineageWho bdr:P1132 ;
            :lineageReceived [ a :LineageReceived ;
                  :lineageFrom bdr:P3094 ]

      :lineageHolder [ a :LineageHolder ;
            :lineageWho bdr:P1034 ;

                  :lineageFrom bdr:P1132 ]
            ]
. . .

This illustrates that while bdr:P3094 received the :Lineage from bdr:P502 in both cases, bdr:P502 received the lineage from bdr:P3093 in one case and from bdr:P1226 in the other. The two :Lineages are both of the same type and are transmitting the same object, bdr:T976, so this example illustrates the use of :lineageDownFrom to simplify the recording in a gsan yig or thob yig while highlighting some of the commonalities.'''@en ;

Gonpa per ecumen would be how many temples are there per one sq km of land area minus water, bare rock, ice and so forth.  Thus I totaled the ecumen areas of each township primarily in terms of the sq km of grassland and forests and farmland.  Then because these areas per temple are so tiny I represented the final amounts on my map legend per 1000 sq km so that the numbers would be closer to 1.0 at times.  For example there might only be .0000001 temples per sq km of ecumen.  But if we convert to per 1000 sq km of ecumen we get .0001 temples  which is a more understandable amount.  Though I think most scholars are baffled by technology and so just understand the idea of core areas like the Lhasa valley compared the peripheral areas like the Changthang.
