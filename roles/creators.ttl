In the case of Chinese texts, the persons who function in the translation group as experts in the Indic traditions in question can sometimes be identified primarily by other function labels, such as \"head translator\"; we use this creator type primarily as an equivalent for persons whom the Chinese tradition states \"handled the Indic text\", Chn.
